# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

70%
100% of lecture 1 because I completely missed it because of work (split watching the 2 perspectives because I didn't realise I was watching the Cairns perspective until it was too late)
not much of the second one...
## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Because I usually miss the lectures due to my current timetable (busy for lectures but available or trying to be for pracs)

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I really like it, it really challenges me and makes me get creative. I love seeing my frustrations lead to something.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Not do everything last minute, like this which is 11:50

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Loops, I really need to improve on that - as well as my code fidelity and unnecessary fat.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I really like consuming the content that's given to me. I feel like my understanding of coding from high school - moreso the basics - is really coming back to me.
